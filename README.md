# Dependencies

Prior to building the following dependencies need to be installed:
- `mocap_msgs`: https://github.com/MOCAP4ROS2-Project/mocap_msgs
- `mocap_control`: packaged as a part of `mocap` here - https://github.com/MOCAP4ROS2-Project/mocap

# Building

- `colcon build --packages-up-to mocap_vicon_driver` should build the aforementioned dependencies and the MOCAP package itself

# Configuration

- Check `config/mocap_vicon_driver_params.yaml`. `host_name` should be the IP address of the machine running VICON tracker. 

# Launching

`ros2 launch mocap_vicon_driver mocap_vicon_driver_launch.py`
